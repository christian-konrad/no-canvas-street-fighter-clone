# No Canvas Street Fighter Clone

## Experimental Street Fighter Clone in plain JS and CSS without the use of Canvas or Frameworks

This is a simple Street Fighter clone prototype to test the limits of HTML, vanilla JS and CSS in terms of rendering a 2D Beat'em'up game. It does not use canvas to render the frames and even no frameworks are used (ok, I used `jQuery` for convenience, but let's leave that out).

Control the character using **WASD** or **arrow keys** and **Ctrl** for *blocking* and **Space** for *punching*.

If running on a mobile device, you can use the onscreen keys as well.
